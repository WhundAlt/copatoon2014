<email>Dear Moe,
Congratulations on becoming a member of the Cubeez Club.  We've sent you an official members certificate to hang on your wall or fridge.
We really hope you enjoy using the website, there are so many fun things to do and don't forget to check your sticker book once you have completed an activity.
Thank you for helping us in our adventures. 
Come back soon! http://www.cubeez.com.
Love from
Cubeez
