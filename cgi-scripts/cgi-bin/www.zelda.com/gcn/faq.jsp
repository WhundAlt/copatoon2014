<p><strong>What if I can't figure out how to solve a puzzle?</strong><br />
Perhaps you've overlooked something important. Use the C-Stick to manipulate the camera and check your surroundings. Look for doors or passageways you may have missed. You can also use the Tingle Tuner to get hints through cooperative play.</p>

<p><strong>Does L-Targeting offer anything particularly good?</strong><br />
By L-Targeting an opponent, you can keep it in sight during battle and hit it more precisely. L-Targeting is particularly useful against very quick enemies and flying enemies, and using distance weapons like the Boomerang while L-Targeting ensures much greater accuracy. You can also speak to people from a distance by L-Targeting them first.</p>

<p><strong>My Hearts run out too quickly ... What should I do?</strong><br />
Each time you defeat a dungeon boss, you will gain one more Heart Container. You can also increase your life gauge by searching for Pieces of Heart. Four Pieces of Heart combine to complete one Heart Container.</p>

<p><strong>The enemies are too tough ... How can I defeat them?</strong><br />
All enemies have weaknesses, so if one method of attack doesn't work, try another. Also, every time you get a new item, try using it as much as you can. You will almost always have some item that will help you overcome your foes. You should also watch your enemies carefully&#151;they may drop their weapons. If they do, take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>Why does my Controller rumble inexplicably?</strong><br />
The Controller rumbles when Link is struck or attacked, but it will also rumble when a particular item is trying to tell you something. If the A Button icon changes shape, try pressing the A Button to see what's up. But remember, you won't get rumble hints if your Rumble Feature is turned off.</p>

<p><strong>How can I become a Master Swordsman?</strong><br />
First, go to visit Orca on Outset Island and learn how to use a sword. After that, it just takes practice. Repeatedly tapping the B Button and pressing it in conjunction with the Control Stick will allow you to attack with successive blows. Also, if the A Button changes shape while you're fighting with your sword, immediately press the A Button again to perform a parry move. Only then you will know what it means to be a true Master Swordsman.</p>

<p><strong>How do I use the Tingle Tuner?</strong><br />
After you get the Tingle Tuner in the Windfall Island jail, insert the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable into Controller Socket 2, 3 or 4. Connect the cable to your Game Boy Advance and turn the Game Boy Advance on.  The player controlling Link must use the Tingle Tuner item (like any other item) to call Tingle and activate the Tingle Tuner.</p>
